# Django Web App Deployment on AWS ECS

This repository demonstrates how to **containerize** a simple Django application and **deploy it on AWS ECS (Fargate)** using:

- Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- ECS Cluster with Fargate Launch Type
- Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Auto Scaling Group for scalability

 🚀 What Was Done

1. **Containerization with Docker**
- A `Dockerfile` was created to build the Django app image.
- The project was made compatible for containerization (adding `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Docker image was tested locally using `docker run`.

2. **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**
- Created an ECR repository to host the Docker image.
- Logged in to ECR and pushed the image.

3. ECS Cluster Setup
   Created an ECS Cluster using the Fargate launch type.

   Defined a Task Definition pointing to the image on ECR.

   Created a Service in ECS that manages tasks and integrates with:

   Application Load Balancer

   Auto Scaling policies

4. Networking & Load Balancing
   Configured:

   VPC & Subnets

   Security Groups to allow inbound HTTP traffic

   Set up a Load Balancer to route traffic to ECS tasks.

5. Auto Scaling
   Added auto-scaling rules based on CPU usage.

   Enabled ECS Service Auto Scaling via Target Tracking policy.
